# Update the following code so that, instead of printing the values,
# each statement prints the name of the class to which it belongs.

puts "Hello".class
puts 5.class
puts [1, 2, 3].class
# Expected output:

# String
# Integer               # "Fixnum" if you're using Ruby version older than 2.4.0
# Array
