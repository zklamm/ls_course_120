# This is one of the hardest exercises in this exercise set. It uses both
# exceptions and Object#send, neither of which we've discussed in detail before
# now. Think of this exercise as one that pushes you to learn new things on
# your own, and don't worry if you can't solve it.

# You may remember our Minilang language from back in the 101 Medium exercises.
# We return to that language now, but this time we'll be using OOP. If you need
# a refresher, refer back to that exercise.

# Write a class that implements a miniature stack-and-register-based
# programming language that has the following commands:

# n Place a value n in the "register". Do not modify the stack.
# PUSH Push the register value on to the stack. Leave the value in the register.
# ADD Pops a value from the stack and adds it to the register value, storing
# the result in the register.
# SUB Pops a value from the stack and subtracts it from the register value,
# storing the result in the register.
# MULT Pops a value from the stack and multiplies it by the register value,
# storing the result in the register.
# DIV Pops a value from the stack and divides it into the register value,
# storing the integer result in the register.
# MOD Pops a value from the stack and divides it into the register value,
# storing the integer remainder of the division in the register.
# POP Remove the topmost item from the stack and place in register
# PRINT Print the register value
# All operations are integer operations (which is only important with DIV and
# MOD).

# Programs will be supplied to your language method via a string passed in as
# an argument. Your program should produce an error if an unexpected item is
# present in the string, or if a required stack value is not on the stack when
# it should be (the stack is empty). In all error cases, no further processing
# should be performed on the program.

# You should initialize the register to 0.

# 0

Minilang.new('5 PUSH 3 MULT PRINT').eval
# 15

Minilang.new('5 PRINT PUSH 3 PRINT ADD PRINT').eval
# 5
# 3
# 8

Minilang.new('5 PUSH 10 PRINT POP PRINT').eval
# 10
# 5

Minilang.new('5 PUSH POP POP PRINT').eval
# Empty stack!

Minilang.new('3 PUSH PUSH 7 DIV MULT PRINT ').eval
# 6

Minilang.new('4 PUSH PUSH 7 MOD MULT PRINT ').eval
# 12

Minilang.new('-3 PUSH 5 XSUB PRINT').eval
# Invalid token: XSUB

Minilang.new('-3 PUSH 5 SUB PRINT').eval
# 8

Minilang.new('6 PUSH').eval
# (nothing printed; no PRINT commands)
