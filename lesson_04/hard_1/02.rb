# This new class does not fit well with the object hierarchy defined so far.
# Catamarans don't have tires. But we still want common code to track fuel
# efficiency and range. Modify the class definitions and move code into a Module,
# as necessary, to share code among the Catamaran and the wheeled vehicles.
